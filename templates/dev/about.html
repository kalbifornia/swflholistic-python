  <h3>In Joe's own words</h3>
  <p>I am a man seeking to live intentionally and do work that is in alignment with my values and with my goal: to help empower others to improve their health, reverse chronic disease, and take control over their lives. I am a software engineer, and I intend to further focus my technical skills towards that goal.</p>

  <h4>Why I Care About Holistic Health</h4>
  <p>I wasn't always focused on holistic health. In fact, I didn't have any interest or particular knowledge about it until 2017. In 2017, through podcasts and social media, I began learning that many people were overcoming chronic diseases. Ones I'd always been led to believe were genetic; diseases that you just had to live with ("There's nothing you can do about it"). Diet played a HUGE role. After digging further into this information, I kept looking for the "catch". Meanwhile, I started applying some of the changes I was learning about to my own diet and my own life. Even though I didn't consider myself unhealthy before, I still was able to apply changes that made a remarkably positive impact on my digestive health, my skin, and my overall energy levels. (My path was via a low-carbohydrate, beef-dominant diet; a few details of my story are available <a href="https://carnivore.diet/joe-improved-digestion-acne-joint-pain-carnivore-diet/">here</a>.)</p>
  <p>I felt incredibly fortunate to have stumbled onto this information, but I wanted everyone to have this beneficial information. The concepts which could help so many people just seemed "hidden in plain sight". I wanted to shout about this from the rooftops. My initial way of doing that was by talking about it with some friends and posting on social media (mostly my now-defunct Twitter account). I started a blog to write about what I was learning: <a href="http://joehealthblog.blogspot.com">Joe Health Blog</a>. I built a website focused on categorizing real-world cases of disease reversal: <a href="http://diseasereversals.com">DiseaseReversals.com</a>. I started a Keto Meetup group to try to make real-world local contacts. I've joined a local health group chapter (<a href="https://westonaprice.org">WAPF</a>) and developed an <a href="https://www.joekalb.com/holistic">Online Holistic Resource Directory</a> to help out our members. And finally, I hosted and produced a podcast called <a href="https://youcuredwhat.com">You Cured What?!</a> to feature real people's inspirational stories of overcoming disease and achieving more abundant health.</p>
  <p>The power of the human body to adapt and to heal is remarkable; I believe men and women are much more powerful and much more capable than we are typically led to believe. I desire to spread that message to others in my personal life, in my "side project" time, and in my vocation. I look forward to a time in the near future when I will be earning a living as an engineer developing software not just for any generic corporate goal, but for a health-, life-, and spirit-building mission.
